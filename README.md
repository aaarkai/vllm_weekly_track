# vLLM Weekly Tracker

This repository automatically tracks weekly changes in the [vLLM project](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) by generating structured release notes and maintaining a complete backup of all merged pull requests.

## How It Works

Every Friday, two GitHub Actions run to track vLLM development:

1. **Structured Release Notes** (`gemini_sum.yml`):
   - Fetch all merged pull requests from the vLLM repository in the last 7 days
   - Categorize the PRs into detailed sections based on their content:
     - ‚ú® Features & Enhancements
     - üêõ Bug Fixes
     - ‚ö°Ô∏è Performance
     - ü§ñ Model Support
     - üîå Hardware & Backend
     - ‚öôÔ∏è Refactoring & Core
     - üîß Build, CI & Testing
     - üìö Documentation
     - üì¶ Miscellaneous
   - Generate a comprehensive release notes document with these categorized PRs
   - Include a list of all contributors for the week
   - Save as `weekly-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

2. **Complete PR Backup** (`fetch_prs.yml`):
   - Fetch all merged pull requests from the vLLM repository in the last 7 days
   - Generate a complete chronological list of all PRs
   - Save as `weekly-PR-list-YYYY-MM-DD.md`

## Example Output

## Accessing the Release Notes

You can find the weekly files in the [`summaries/`](summaries/) directory:

- **Structured release notes**: `weekly-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (categorized view)
- **Complete PR backup**: `weekly-PR-list-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (chronological list)

Each release note includes:
- Categorized pull requests with direct links to the PRs
- Author attribution for each contribution
- A comprehensive list of all contributors for the week

## Customization

To adapt this for tracking a different repository:

1. Fork this repository
2. Update the `UPSTREAM_REPO` variable in both workflow files:
   - [`.github/workflows/gemini_sum.yml`](.github/workflows/gemini_sum.yml) (structured release notes)
   - [`.github/workflows/fetch_prs.yml`](.github/workflows/fetch_prs.yml) (complete PR backup)
3. Adjust the cron schedules in both workflow files if needed
4. Modify the categorization patterns in `.github/workflows/gemini_sum.yml` if your repository uses different naming conventions

## Local Testing

For local development and testing:

```bash
./test_release_notes.sh
```

This will generate a sample release notes file based on recent vLLM PRs without requiring GitHub CLI authentication.
